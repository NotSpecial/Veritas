# HMM model parameters: This relates to the initial probability, transition probability and the emission probability of 
# the states in the HMM model. We initialise the states with uniform probability and use asymmetric Gaussian model for 
# the transition probabilities. The smoothing parameter is used for Gaussian transition model. And we allow certain states 
# which seem not possible using the Gaussian transtion model, within certain steps of the current state. We use different 
# domain specific emission models based on dataset. Additional models for each component of the can be added to the system. 
# The learning rate of the different models can be chosen by user based on computational resources and 
# tuned using hyperparameter tuning.

# Domain emission model parameters: We add uncertainty to the emission model in the form of Gaussian white noise with 
# a learnable variance. In our experiments we use a higher variance for the first few chunks (head) to model TCP slow start 
# effects at the start of the session. These parameters are generally lower than the capacity step size and can be tuned per dataset.
